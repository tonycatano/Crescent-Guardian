If you don't feel like typing GM commands
anymore, try the ***new graphical interface**!*
:star2: :smiley: :star2:

Use the new **Update** button at the bottom 
of the GM List to add, edit, or delete GMs, 
as well as update the boss scroll count.

If a GM List isn't currently displayed, use 
the new **Display GM List** option in the 
message context menu.

Click [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tuu8xm8esycll0e/SneakPeek.mp4?raw=1) for a short demo on the new 
graphical interface. 

If you like typing your commands, I got 
you! All legacy slash commands are still 
available, including the new **/gmupdate** 
command.
